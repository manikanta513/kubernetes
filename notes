POD:

each pod can have  more than one containers. which are dependent on each other . 

disadvantage of pods : by passing config files to the kubectl we can update the containers images in pods. but we cant replicate the containers so we have to use object of type deployment.

refer to the file client-pod.yaml (this file has config of pod creation)

SERVICES:

it setup network for the pods created in kuberenetes cluster

refer to the file client-network.yaml (this file has config of network creation)
